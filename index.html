		<p id="aboutPara1"> Hello, my name is Robert Benjamin. I'm originally from Long Island. Since graduating high school I've lived in San Francisco and now Charlotte. I graduated from Wingate University with a degree in management. While in college I started an online CLEP exam preparation service, Credits4Less. Since launch, we've helped hundreds of individuals earn college credits through the CollegeBoard's CLEP exams.</p>

		<p id="aboutPara2">After graduating college I moved to Silicon Valley where I was first exposed to the tech scene. Since being exposed to the tech scene I've continued to build out my business and began working for a real estate startup, OffrBox. Since launching in November of 2016, we've grown to be the largest and fastest growing online residential investment marketplace.</p>
